% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Stellar limb darkening impacts a wide range of astronomical measurements. The
accuracy to which it is modeled limits the accuracy in any covariant parameters 
of interest, such as the radius of a transiting planet. With the ever growing 
availability of precise observations and the importance of robust estimates of 
astrophysical parameters, an emerging trend has been to freely fit the limb 
darkening coefficients (LDCs) describing a limb darkening law of choice, in
order to propagate our ignorance of the true intensity profile. In practice,
this approach has been limited to two-parameter limb darkening laws, such as the
quadratic law, due to the relative ease of sampling the physically allowed
range of LDCs. Here, we provide a highly efficient method for sampling LDCs
describing a more accurate three-parameter non-linear law. We first derive 
analytic criteria which can quickly test if a set of LDCs are physical, although 
naive sampling with these criteria leads to an acceptance rate less than 1\%. We 
then show that the loci of allowed LDCs can be transformed into a cone-like 
volume, from which we are able to draw uniform samples. We show that samples 
drawn uniformly from the conal region are physically valid in 97.3\% of 
realizations and encompass 94.4\% of the volume of allowed parameter space. We 
provide Python and Fortran code (\LDC) to sample from this region (and perform 
the reverse calculation) at \link, which also includes a subroutine to 
efficiently test whether a sample is physically valid or not.
